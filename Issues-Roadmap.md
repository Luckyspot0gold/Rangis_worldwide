# Project Status & Roadmap

## Honest Assessment from the Builder (Justin)

I pushed for 60 hours to get this vision submitted. I hit a wall with the XION Dave Mobile Kit integrationâ€”specifically around configuring the environment for gasless transactions and wallet connections. The conceptual framework is all here, and the code structure is started, but the final bridge to XION's SDK needs to be built.

This isn't a failure; it's a snapshot of the ambitious, messy process of innovation.

## Immediate Next Steps (Post-Hackathon)

1.  **Integrate XION Dave SDK:** Properly configure the `@burnt-labs/abstraxion-react-native` package for biometric authentication.
2.  **Implement Gasless Transactions:** Connect the sonification engine to XION's testnet for seamless, fee-less trades.
3.  **Build a Minimal Mobile UI:** A simple React Native interface to control the sensory experience.
4.  **Connect Live Data:** Pipe real-time data from CoinGecko into the harmonic engine.

I am seeking technical co-founders and collaborators to help me build this vision. If you're interested, please open an issue on this repo!
