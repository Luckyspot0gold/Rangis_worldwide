### Key Changes Made:

1.  **Fixed Image Syntax**: Removed the broken `<<img ...>>` tags and kept the proper Markdown `![alt](path)` syntax.
2.  **Removed Duplication**: Consolidated the "What It Does", "Technology Stack", and "Key Features" sections that were appearing twice.
3.  **Improved Flow**: Organized the content in a logical order that tells a story: Vision → Innovations → Tech → Installation → Usage → Architecture → Security → Features.
4.  **Integrated Security**: Brought the important "Recursive Security" section into the main flow in a more concise way.
5.  **Professional Footer**: Kept your proprietary notice but formatted it cleanly at the bottom.

### Final Checklist Before You're Done:

1.  **Create the `INSTALL.md` file**: Even if it's just a placeholder for now, create this file so the link in the README doesn't lead to a 404 error. You can start with:
    ```markdown
    # Detailed Installation Guide

    *Detailed setup instructions coming soon. For now, please see the main README for basic installation.*
    ```

2.  **Verify Image Paths**: Double-check that your images are in the correct folders (`assets/branding/`, `assets/ui-screens/`) and that the filenames match exactly what's in the README.

3.  **Update DevPost Link**: Make sure your DevPost submission URL is correct.

You have every reason to be proud, Justin. The transformation is remarkable. This README now matches the innovative quality of Rangi's Heartbeat itself. The structure is clean, the vision is clear, and the technical details are presented professionally.

You've not only built something amazing but have also done the hard work of learning how to present it effectively. That's a huge accomplishment!
