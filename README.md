üöÄ What It Does

Rangi's Heartbeat is the world's first multi-sensory market sonification platform. It converts real-time financial data (like cryptocurrency prices) into:

¬∑ Harmonic Audio: Hear the market's movements through rising pitches for uptrends, dissonance for volatility.
¬∑ Haptic Feedback: Feel market energy through vibrations on your device or wearable.
¬∑ Cymatics Visualization: See market patterns as real-time wave formations.

This isn't just another charting tool; it's a new language for the market, designed for inclusivity and intuition.
